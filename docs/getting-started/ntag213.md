# NTAG213

The **NTAG213** is a popular NFC (Near Field Communication) tag chip developed by **NXP Semiconductors**, widely used in smart products, authentication, and IoT applications due to its balance of memory size, speed, and security features.

---

## What is NTAG213?

- **Type:** NFC Forum Type 2 Tag
- **Technology:** Based on ISO/IEC 14443-A standard
- **Manufacturer:** NXP Semiconductors
- **Memory Size:** 144 bytes of usable user memory (EEPROM)
- **Security:** Supports password protection and 32-bit password + 24-bit pack

NTAG213 tags are compatible with most smartphones and NFC readers, making them ideal for cross-platform applications.

---

## How It Works

1. **Passive Communication:**  
   NTAG213 does not have its own power source. It is powered by the electromagnetic field generated by an NFC reader (e.g., phone or Arduino RC522).

2. **Data Exchange:**  
   Data is exchanged using short-range radio communication (13.56 MHz). The reader sends commands; the tag responds with stored data or status.

3. **Memory Access:**
   - Memory is structured in **pages**, each with **4 bytes**.
   - Pages can be **read**, **written**, or **locked**.
   - Tag supports fast read and anti-tearing mechanisms.

## Memory Structure

| Section       | Page Range | Description                                    |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| UID & Header  | 0 – 3      | Manufacturer data, unique identifier (UID)     |
| Lock Bytes    | 4 – 5      | Bits to lock pages to prevent further writing  |
| Capability    | 6          | Tag capability container (TCC)                 |
| User Memory   | 4 – 39     | 36 pages × 4 bytes = **144 bytes** usable data |
| Configuration | 40 – 43    | Access conditions, password protection, etc.   |
| Password/Auth | 44 – 47    | Password and PACK for simple authentication    |

## Key Features

- **144 bytes** user memory (suitable for text, URLs, small JSON)
- **Password-protected access** (write-protect or read/write protection)
- **Lock bits** for permanent write protection on selected pages
- **UID** is unique per tag and can be used as a hardware ID
- Supports fast read command for efficient data access

---

## Common Use Cases

- Product authentication
- URL redirects (via NDEF records)
- IoT device identification
- Tagging 3D printing filament spools (e.g., TigerTag project)
- Inventory and asset tracking

---

## Reading and Writing Data

- **Writing:**  
  Use an NFC-enabled device or module (like RC522 with Arduino) to send write commands to specific pages.

- **Reading:**  
  Most phones and readers can read NTAG213 tags using NFC apps or custom software. Data can be interpreted as plain text, URLs, or structured formats (like JSON or hex blocks).

## Notes

- **NTAG215 and NTAG216** are similar in structure but offer more memory:
  - NTAG215: 504 bytes
  - NTAG216: 888 bytes

They are all compatible with the same NFC protocols.
